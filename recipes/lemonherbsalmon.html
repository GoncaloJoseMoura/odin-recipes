<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 salmon fillets, skin removed (about 2 lbs. (900g) total)</li>
    <li>4 cups halved brussels sprouts</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary (or use 1 Tablespoon dried)</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (or use 1 Tablespoon dried)</li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>2 medium lemons, divided</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
    <li>sea salt, to taste</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Arrange salmon and brussels sprouts evenly spaced on top.</li>
    <li>Brush the melted butter on top of each salmon fillet. In a small bowl, stir the rosemary, parsley, garlic, juice of 1 lemon (around 4 Tablespoons), and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together. Spoon evenly onto each fillet, spreading all over the top. Slice 1/2 of the 2nd lemon and arrange 1-2 slices on top of each fillet. Squeeze the other lemon half on top of the brussels sprouts. Sprinkle the brussels sprouts with remaining 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. Sprinkle sea salt evenly over the whole pan—not much is needed, but go by your preference.</li>
    <li>Bake the salmon for 15-20 minutes depending on thickness, about 10 minutes per 1-inch inch thickness measured from the thickest part of the fillet or until the thickest part reaches 145°F (63°C) internal heat.</li>
    <li>Serve warm.</li>
    <li>Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator for a few days. Reheat to your liking.</li>
</ol>
